Get back to your roots by finding out why root beer is the superior cola.

The purpose of this project is to make a responsive, static page that emphasizes the superiority of root beer to the inferior colas. 

I will apply best practices with regards to responsive design and SASS structure that are optimal *for this project*.

e.g. I'm not going to use the 7-1 pattern for SASS because that's overkill, but I will be using well-named partials as specified in an [article](https://medium.com/@dannyhuang_75970/sass-project-structure-for-big-projects-8c4a740846ee) about SASS project structure by [Danny Huang](https://medium.com/@dannyhuang_75970).

Additionally, I am going to restrict the scope of responsiveness by ignoring tablets, since they only make up around 3-4% of website traffic depending on your source.

Honestly, persuasion is not the main goal since fighting against cola nostalgia/familiarity is a losing battle. Did you know that Coca Cola did [blind taste tests](https://www.history.com/news/why-coca-cola-new-coke-flopped) back in the 80's that strongly favored the new flavor, but it flopped because people don't like change?
